## How to Use

</div>

First, you need to fill in all of the values in [`config.json`](/config.json). In this case, it's just your bot token and a list of `points:role` properties. If a user gets the required amount of points, the role with the corresponding ID will be given to them. For example:

```json
{
  "roleRewards": {
    "10": "1234567890",
    "50": "1234567890",
    "150": "1234567890"
  },
  "token": "Nzc1NzAwOTU1NDc4OPogChampYouFoundASecretzw.kC8rs9qP3qCCb4SzRW2LOaLxsrQ"
}
```

**Make sure the bot's role is above any you want to assign**. That's basically all the configuration setup needed, everything else works out of the box!

<br>

This bot mainly consists of one feature: the [`Quiz`](/classes/quiz). When the appropriate command is executed, a new `Quiz` will be created, and all other commands will reference that `Quiz` until it ends. There are two _modes_ to the quiz.

- Normal (`+play`) - The bot plays a song and gives you thirty seconds to name the title of the song _or_ the anime in the text channel. After 30 seconds, it skips automatically. You can set a goal through the command, such as `5`, and the bot will end the game once someone reaches `5` points. If someone guess correctly, A point is given to them in the quiz scoreboard _and_ the global scoreboard.

- Freeplay (`+freeplay`) - No competition or 30 second snippets; the bot just plays a random anime opening all the way through and then skips to the next one until you tell it to stop. Useful for background music.
